# QR Codes

A small, over the weekend project. I saw [Telegram's](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54270105/155898377-a85fc209-0e29-40a0-bb86-b164f098ed78.JPG) generated QR codes and thought it would be cool to see how they do it. Turns out it's not that easy to create a custom, beautiful QR code image. I built the app though. A one screen app to create QR codes for URLs. It does some very basic checking for the enetered URL to see whether or not it's a valid URL.

I might dive into [CIFilter](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CoreImageFilterReference/) and play around the names and filters until I get the look I want. But for now, this is all I have.
